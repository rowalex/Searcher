The action of the game is set in the future, where mankind has begun to colonize new planets. The game takes place on a new planet called "B1G". This planet is 8 times larger than Earth and has a dense atmosphere that allows large ships to float within its boundaries. The planet is filled with giant flora and fauna, with a very tough outer cover that does not allow you to eliminate the creatures with conventional weapons. 
Due to the inhabitants of the new planet, the management of New Planets, instead of the usual colonization, decided to send a research team of 100 people to the planet to create a complex and study the local inhabitants, looking for their weaknesses.
The protagonist of the game is one of the employees of the company "New Planets", who was sent to the research complex on the newly discovered planet "B1G" in order to study it. Upon arrival, the protagonist is told about his job as a field scientist and is trained to fly a flying ship. After training, the player performs tasks of the management to collect and analyze the local flora and fauna.
